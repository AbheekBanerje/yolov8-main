# 🧠 YOLOv8 Object Detection - Ultralytics

This project demonstrates a real-time **object detection system** built using **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once, version 8) — a cutting-edge model developed by Ultralytics. It allows you to detect and label multiple object classes in images, videos, or live webcam streams with high accuracy and speed.
